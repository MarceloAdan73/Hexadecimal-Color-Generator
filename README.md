This code is a small application that generates a color palette in hexadecimal format.

-First define a container in the HTML with the id `palleteContainer` where the colors will be displayed.
-Then also uses an input of type `range` with id `colorRange` to adjust the number of dynamically generated colors.
-With an array called `colorValues` that contains the necessary digits and letters, generates colors in hexadecimal format.
-Set the pallet size to `PALLETE_SIZE`, which in this case is 5.
-The `createPallete()` function creates the palette. Clears the container, then creates divs for each color and adds them to the container.
-The `colorize(element)` function is responsible for assigning a random color to each element in the palette. Generates a random color in hexadecimal format and applies it as the background of the element, and also displays the hexadecimal code inside the element.
-The `updatePallete()` function updates all colors in the palette by calling `colorize()` for each element in the container.
-Finally, `createPallete()` is called to generate the palette when the page loads.
